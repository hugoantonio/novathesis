abstract = {To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production, the complex agricultural ecosystems need to be better understood. This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.},

abstract = {Crop losses caused by pests, including rodents and birds, and by diseases and weeds, are defined, and previous studies reviewed. Information about losses is needed to monitor the effects of pests and diseases on crop production, in individual countries and worldwide, important for food policy and economic reasons; to make decisions and allocate resources on the study, management and control of pests and diseases; to stimulate action against them; to provide guidelines for research on crop improvement to prevent pest and disease attack; and as a basis for judgement on the importance of pests, diseases and weeds in relation to agriculture and the environment. The causes of such losses, why information must be up to date, and methods of assessing pests, diseases, weeds and losses are examined. The part played by losses in the development and use of economic pest and disease control action thresholds is discussed, including pest, disease, crop, climatic, economic and farmer attitude factors. The types of relation between yield and pest and disease attack are reviewed, how to measure the relation in practice, how to obtain different amounts of attack, surveys of losses, and the difficulties met in the study of losses: interaction; compensation; interplot interference; variation; and distribution. Sources of information on world losses, training and the work of the FAO are reviewed. General guidelines on crop loss assessment are given. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

@article{Sharma2014,
abstract = {Climate change and global warming will have serious consequences for the diversity and abundance of arthropods, and the extent of losses due to insect pests, which will impact both crop production and food security. Prediction of changes in geographical distribution and population dynamics of insect pests will be useful for adapting pest management strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on crop production. Pest outbreaks might occur more frequently, particularly during extended periods of drought, followed by heavy rainfall. Some of the components of pest management such as host-plant resistance, biopesticides, natural enemies, and synthetic chemicals will be rendered less effective as a result of the increase in temperatures and UV radiation, and decrease in relative humidity. The rate of insect multiplication might increase with an increase in CO2 and temperature. Thus climate change might change the population dynamics of insect pests differently in different agro-ecosystem and ecological zones. Therefore, there is a need to take a concerted look at the likely effects of climate change on crop protection and devise appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on food security.},

@article{Khanal2017,
abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies to identify in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices and optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS) that utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil monitoring. Optical RS, however, is slow in differentiating stress levels in crops until visual symptoms become noticeable. Surface temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable that can indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring estimates of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a promising tool for PA. Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal RS for PA have been limited. Until recently (i.e., before the advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned aerial systems (UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was limited due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs, thermal images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become available at a low cost, which has increased opportunities to understand in-field variability of crop and soil conditions useful for various agronomic decision-making. Before thermal RS is adopted as a routine tool for crop and environmental monitoring, there is a need to understand its current and potential applications as well as issues and concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications of thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application. The application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here include irrigation scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease detection, and mapping of soil properties, residues and tillage, field tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues related to its application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric conditions, and crop growth stages.},

@article{Kruize2016,
abstract = {Smart farming is a management style that includes smart monitoring, planning and control of agricultural processes. This management style requires the use of a wide variety of software and hardware systems from multiple vendors. Adoption of smart farming is hampered because of a poor interoperability and data exchange between ICT components hindering integration. Software Ecosystems is a recent emerging concept in software engineering that addresses these integration challenges. Currently, several Software Ecosystems for farming are emerging. To guide and accelerate these developments, this paper provides a reference architecture for Farm Software Ecosystems. This reference architecture should be used to map, assess design and implement Farm Software Ecosystems. A key feature of this architecture is a particular configuration approach to connect ICT components developed by multiple vendors in a meaningful, feasible and coherent way. The reference architecture is evaluated by verification of the design with the requirements and by mapping two existing Farm Software Ecosystems using the Farm Software Ecosystem Reference Architecture. This mapping showed that the reference architecture provides insight into Farm Software Ecosystems as it can describe similarities and differences. A main conclusion is that the two existing Farm Software Ecosystems can improve configuration of different ICT components. Future research is needed to enhance configuration in Farm Software Ecosystems.},

To make profitable decisions, farmers need information throughout the entire farming cycle. The required information is scattered in various places which includes real time information such as market prices and current production level stats along with the available primary crop knowledge. A knowledge dataflow model is constructed connecting various scattered sources to the crop structures. The world around is getting automated replacing manual procedures with the advancement of technology, since it is energy efficient and engross minimal man power. The paper proposes the advantages of having ICT in Indian agricultural sector, which shows the path for rural farmers to replace some of the conventional techniques. Monitoring modules are demonstrated using various sensors for which the inputs are fed from Knowledge base. A prototype of the mechanism is carried out using TI CC3200 Launchpad interconnected sensors modules with other necessary electronic devices. A comparative study is made between the developed system and the existing systems. The system overcomes limitations of traditional agricultural procedures by utilizing water resource efficiently and also reducing labour cost.},

abstract = {Diseases in plants cause major production and economic losses in agricultural industry worldwide. Monitoring of health and detection of diseases in plants and trees is critical for sustainable agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, there is no sensor commercially available for real-time assessment of health conditions in trees. Currently, scouting is most widely used mechanism for monitoring stress in trees, which is an expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming process. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction are used for the identification of plant diseases that require detailed sampling and processing procedure. Early information on crop health and disease detection can facilitate the control of diseases through proper management strategies such as vector control through pesticide applications, fungicide applications, and disease-specific chemical applications; and can improve productivity. The present review recognizes the need for developing a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable health-monitoring sensor that would facilitate advancements in agriculture. It describes the currently used technologies that can be used for developing a ground-based sensor system to assist in monitoring health and diseases in plants under field conditions. These technologies include spectroscopic and imaging-based, and volatile profiling-based plant disease detection methods. The paper compares the benefits and limitations of these potential methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
